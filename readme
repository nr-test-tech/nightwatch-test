To run selenium webdriver in Chrome browser, we need to take the help of ChromeDriver which is a 
separate executable that selenium webdriver uses to control chrome. 
ChromeDriver is a standalone server which implements WebDriver's wire protocol for Chromium.

Steps
1. Install Java and set path in environment veriable 
2. Create a lib folder in root directory => Download selenium-server-standalone-3.141.59.jar 
      and chromedriver.exe and place both inside lib folder(here it is externally we can install through npm also).
3. npm install nightwatch 
4. npm init --yes => this will create package.json
5. create nightwatch.conf.js file in root folder 
6. configure nightwatch.conf.js file with selenium and chromedriver details
7. require('nightwatch/bin/runner.js')in nightwatch.js file; 
      this will allow Selenium Server is running locally and is managed by Nightwatch
8. create test.js file to write testcases.
9. execute file in node => node nightwatch.js -e tests/test1.js
